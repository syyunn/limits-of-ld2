# limits-of-ld2
List up some shortage of using publicly available lobby data

## Quarter-based publications
Sometimes we need to track the effect between one-two weeks of change induced by the lobby, but lobby date is not fixed to the submit date

## No-fine-grained level of Gov Agencies 
LD2 usually contains department or Committee level of gov contact info, however, we need more fine-grained level, such as `COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR XXXX of U.S. Senate, Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations`
